        <h2>Hiya Kimaya,</h2>
        <p>If everything goes my way hopefully, there you are in your room with your laptop reading this. There's so much to say but let's get through this. Ah, I have been planning this ever since Valentine's. You were at Isha and I thought of making the website and sending it on Gmail but didn't exactly think it would work out, couldn't get the time right either and well, so much happened after that.</p>
        <p>But I am so sure everyday for 4 months since that day I have been planning what to tell. Yet here I am speechless. Maybe I'm just anxious or scared to face the outcomes. Ah, but not anymore I suppose. Let me put everything that I can. Not the best writer so bare with me, you ladythames.</p>
        <h2>Seven Years</h2>
        <p>Do you remember how we met Kimaya? I think I might. I'm not sure but I think I dreamt of the memory because suddenly it's so vivid and clear. It was 8th grade you were sitting next to Namrata and chuckling, most probably judging me for how I didn't know this one character from Harry Potter when Namrata pointed it out. That's when I first met you or so for what I remember. You looked different. Shorter hair and different glasses but the smile, that never changed. Beautiful as ever. It has very much been seven long years.</p>
        <p>The number of years required to make a forever bond according to whatever study from some university. From there to whatever happened and boom, COVID and the discord days. I had this chess rivalry going on with friends and the Euroschool management had this idea of hosting a competition in various skills I suppose. Never planned on signing up but when I heard Rohit had signed up, well I immediately signed up. It was a very at the spur of the moment thing. I'd have never done it. Well that's where Namrata found my account and texted through the chess interface. Well Jeevan was already talking to her. So we made a group and then eventually you and Sharada were added. Peekaboo was created.</p>
        <p>When Peekaboo was made and I started talking to you originally, I never really thought of anything. You were just there. And ultimately got to know each other better. I don't exactly remember how but we started talking in DMs. And woah, it was not the same Kimaya I knew from 8th. This girl was out of a book. This extremely nice person at all times who was so accepting and supporting and well she lived life like a golden retriever. Not a day had I seen her being mean to anyone in that good year. You were so nice and I definitely remember us talking about anything and everything, we kept asking each other deep questions and to know that side of you eventually. I didn't think of it much actually but I know I had made a friend.</p>
        <p>Well then cut to all of us meeting on freshers day. Woah. The five of us. It was indeed fun. Nice I suppose. It was a good day. And then eventually 11th grade and you moved to Coimbatore. For what? Art school. When everyone was pursuing engineering or medical, you were there pursuing your passion. Weirdly enough I wasn't surprised. It was so you. You were like that character who used to brighten up people. The exactly analogy I gave was a diya I suppose. Lmao warmth and light and what light not the bland white. Well it was a yellow, a happy yellow.</p>
        <p>But even then everyone started their lives in their new schools. This weird feeling for a good while. This feeling. This weird feeling like I could feel it. This feeling of missing someone. It was not a normal feeling. Missing who? KIMAYA? (happened every time you left to Isha after that btw, leaving pangs did your dad call it? I don't remember lmao). I immediately remember being in class thinking of you and what you would have been doing. Remember coming back and checking discord in the hopes of a text (she doesn’t even have a phone you idiot) so that we could live chat instead of those next day replies. BUT WHY? Why was I missing someone that desperately who I was not even romantically interested in? I was not even that close to you at that point. I had met you like once outside. I immediately mailed to you about it.</p>
        <p>The next day as I came home to that day’s mail. Your longest mail up until that point. Well WHAT IN THE WORLD. You felt the exact same feeling apparently and had this need to tell me everything that you saw there and you were thinking of what I was doing in the class. I was in awe, in awe. But as I scrolled, yes, you did tell me about how you felt about me and how you wanted to ask me out on the last day of school. Well most definitely I did not expect that. Never saw you that way and onegirlguy lmao. But from that day idk it didn’t really change the mails either. We got even more closer. From that day onwards you shared everything to me from periods to actual periods ehe, the mails were definitely longer. Well down the line you also talked about your dating endeavors. A new him in your life. Was definitely extremely possessive for a momentary second. Yes.</p>
        <p>Anyway after that stuff happened in your life, stuff happened in my life to the time where you came back to Bangalore for your holidays. THE BEST TIME. around the mid of 2024. we talked about everything and anything .About what each of us wanted in life and how our pasts went mostly. I got to know you better. All of us had gaming nights and everything. It was a fun time. I knew I knew. You became a best friend. I mean there are other close friends, but this was a different kind. You became that person I wanted to tell everything to. I think we enjoyed talking to each other. And down the line one of the days we were supposed to watch a movie with the group but no one exactly showed up. It ended being only you and me. It was a very weird time in my life and at that point of time I found comfort in movies and that's how I expected my future to go. Watching movies on the day before every weekend cozily in my bed.</p>
        <p>And that day while watching how to lose a guy in 10 days, the only guy that was actually lost was me lmao. Normally people watch movies without sounds, but you my sweet lady , you were reacting to every scene and thats the very first day I heard you laugh. 27th of October 2024. Been head over heels in love with you ever since. OH GOD it was too much to bottle up. I usually never resort to people about anything emotionally deep like this, but idk what I was on. I remember coming back in the bus next day and telling Sharada. Maybe thats the mistake I made, telling other people instead of directly coming to you. But even then I didn't ask her to help me out in the relationship. I remember asking her to tell me to get it out of my head and that Kimaya would never get into stuff like this. But apparently ohmygod, a certain someone had sent this sticker in this group chat. What sticker? It was this sticker from this collection of stickers. A duel where a certain friend had made a sticker of my name sending a whatsapp text of how -I love “and insert girls name from cps.” Every girl by the way. So I took my revenge and made the same set of stickers with his name. Yes not my proudest moment but yes phew. Well apparently when the certain someone sent that sticker in your gc, all of you (gc) thought I was into you. Ohmygod. Well anyway, things escalated way too quickly after that, more people got to know, before I knew it October 31st. I had people coming up to me saying you have to do it today. Wtf what has been going on in the back? I most definitely did not know and then I texted you. well you said to immediately tell what I wanted to tell that day and I was like nah just fuck it I'll tell it. I walked upto my terrace. It was a diwali week. People had been lighting crackers. And I called you. You told me how you had been looking at the fireworks with your mom And I said please go again I wanna say something. And you did. And I told how I felt. I was extremely out of my head by the way. I do not remember anything. It was dark and I only remember the fireworks being lit up in front of me and you laughing in the call and you did say yes. I was extremely delighted. What am I saying? I was jumping and smiling like an idiot. Yash told me later in the call about how you couldn't stop blushing in the hall after the call. What we had was something beautiful Kimaya.</p>
        <p>The day I fell in love, I was certain I'd cross every mountain, traverse countless hills, and even sail across oceans, just to be with you, no matter the distance. I imagined myself braving every storm, walking through every desert, and enduring the longest of nights.I could tell Greek stories of how even fate could not stop what I had like Alcyone and Ceyx.Or like Krishna, how  I would honor a love that transcends being together, choosing a spiritual connection with a pure heart over any worldly obligation. </p>
        <p>Dramatic? </p>
        <p>No obstacle felt too great. With you, the journey itself would always be worth it, no matter how far, no matter how hard but man that was way too soon. I was in the middle of so many things at that time. New college and so many other things were going on in every part of my life. I was already trying to find my place and fit in to it. Should have not got into it that soon and definitely not at that point of time. And the biggest regret, if I did plan on being with you, I did not plan it that early. I wanted to get to know you even better before that but what can I say, things happen. anyway I remember you being happy I was very very much happy too but anxious as hell too. maybe more anxious than happy. the mail days were really fun. Everyday when we mailed each other, I loved it. It was that bestfriend relationship I always wanted and talked about. You were so comfortable with me. Like you told about everything. You did not feel guarded at all. And I loved the fact that I could give you that. B ut as you came back to Bangalore, things changed. At first it was normal. I didn't think much of it. But later woah. You suddenly went radio silent. From that descriptive on mail to what like spending 5 minutes a day. I really did not understand what was happening. I remember calling you everyday for like a week but damn hadn’t returned the calls. I wanted to meet you often. I was losing it. I thought to myself, what was happening. Down the line I thought you lost feelings. Or maybe you never originally did really love me and was just trying out like a temporary thing. Maybe I was just there mailing and like you had a small fling, so you just reciprocated what I felt too. How could it not affect her at all like normally what I felt should have been felt by you too. Even while calling it off on April 14 it shouldn't have been that easy. How did it not hurt her at all I thought to myself. I completely lost it. But this whole thing is a little twisted right. Even though your name is supposed to mean: a divine presence tied with the mystic forces of the universe, you’re as human as anyone can get Kimaya. This whole letter thing was a little off. While I was making this I have been making this for a very long time by the way. It almost is idiotic of how one sided it was, my side.</p>
        
        <h2>The Great Revelation</h2>
        <p>OHMYGOD KIMAYA YOU BABY MY BABY. I am so sorry. What an absolute idiot I have been. You remember the other day like in the middle of the night I texted saying I am extremely sorry. and I mean it with my whole heart. I am absolutely sorry. I was reading about personality types and actually isfp mainly. It struck me. what an absolute fool I have been to not realize that. Kimaya you are this incredibly kind person who seems to have her way with her life touchwood. but you also grew up with emotional events. I was reading the whole article and I forgot to realize how guarded and cautious you are about your personal space. You don't really just put people into your inner circle just like that. You first understand them and then become close friends. Your personal space in this case lets say your home is your happy place. You like your me time. introverted and reserved in a positive way. and I was there messing with your comfort zone. Pulling you out of it, asking so much of you. and my god you always came out of your way Kimaya. How you watched every movie I recommended. BANGALORE DAYS like god how did I make you watch that. you always listened to me yap for like 2 hours on certain days. I know how much you love your parents and I also know how stern they are about certain matters and with all that you still came so much out of your way. I remember how you told me about your tough times from school at an early age on how you felt about yourself and how you were sad about it. you told me how being reserved you didn’t think you had the most fun personality but eventually you did grow out of it and understood how cool you are. You always told me on mail that how you wish you were ambiverted hut honestly you didn't like it and it was draining out your social battery and introverted is the way to go. And well ideally you did feel comfort in me and well what after a while I definitely drained your battery. I am sorry ma'am and Kimaya YOU HAVE THE MOST INTERESTINGLY ATTRACTIVE KIND PERSONALITY. You are as beautiful on the inside as you are on the out. This angel in disguise. I like you as you are. But there I was like a complete idiot putting you in places that was absolutely outside your comfort zone. Also talking about marriage and whatever. OHMYGOD that is way too far. we see life as it comes, who knows if all of us will even be alive in like 10 years. Man I was there scaring you everyday and me questioning if you even loved me? accept it or not, I read every mail since 2022. you had always liked me Kimaya; I was just a blockhead to not see it.You always mailed me on days I did not even mail you for days . Not just any mails , it was the "ohmygod viz this is how my day went " .Hou remember how you said how the idea of me you had in mind changed. I understand. I do not know what I was doing there was so much happening around me at the time. I take it something like, you expected me to understand who you were and thats what you thought I did. Loved you for who you are. and the fact that I was doing expecting someone that wasnt even you. I am sorry Kimaya. And the calling off in april 14. You obviously felt bad too , at least a little. I expected you to call me the closest person to you. I was basically competing with people to be close to you at one point. But man what was I on. It does not work like that for you Kimaya. you dont just put people your inner circle that easily and me this presumptuous idiot wanted to be that close to you straight up showing up that late in your life. I really do not know what I was thinking. I just forgot to understand I dont want to be your closest friend or anything. I just needed to understand that I wanted to be with you and spend time with you whenever you felt comfortable. I thought it was my duty to make you go out there which I thought you wanted . But yes I forgot to understand you were happy with yourself and you didnt want all that. Apathetic is the word you used to describe yourself one day in a call. As much as I know you, no. You are not apathetic. You do care. Maybe not in the way people normally care. But you very much do care. The only one who would still talk to even the most hateful person in a nice way is you. You will still reach out to them. You always reach out to people. But yes you do maybe handle things different emotionally. Very differently. But you are not this apathetic person you portrayed yourself as to me. Or so I believe and you cant change that fact.</p>

        <h2>I remember everything</h2>
        <p>I remember everything Kimaya. The day I found out you were an artist or the day of finding out that you’re of celebrity lineage or the fact that you are Kannada, Telugu AND Marathi. the day of finding out that I could USE EMOJIS on mail or the day I overloaded the Isha computer by sending a 100 mails. The fact that your dad got shat on by a bird or something and you died laughing. Also of how you and your friend were high on caffeine and you peed on a bush or something ehe. Or how you told me about how you were talking to your mom one day and she said the most beautiful thing ever.That she believed your dad is her soulmate touchwood. The day how I walked up to the terrace and called you to the terrace to tell you how I felt about you with the fireworks. the fact that you did not want to wear a dress on farewell so you wore formals. The fact that you were a boycut girl up until a certain age or the fact that you DIDNT know Samantha. Ran away from her dad to go to the first day of school even when he himself was like don't go. LIKE WHAT. The whole chaotic week of me trying to buy you that sweater. Had to make an entire group and get reviews for the right one. Or of how you poured chutney into the kashayam and embarassed yourself infront of a junior. Maybe also the day I was stressing over your Korean jake you fangirled over and I wasn't even a little close to it. Yeah dramatic fs. The day we were matching each others lyrics for the song “sure things” or the day how you lost continuously lost on smash karts and asked me to shutup ehehehehe. Or the day I lost continuously and I was punching the bed. The day all of us pranked Sharada saying Jeevan sent his naked picture. Or the time when both of us as a team defeated him as he got extremely pissed off ehehe which you don't even remember.How can we forget Mithran.
Also of the day I saw you in a saree ,Kimaya, our maknae Kimaya wearing a saree .Or maybe just the fact that you looked pretty and I could not take the picture off my head, forget I said that.</p>
        <p>Well people do ask why do you yearn for her so much. I think its a me thing no one will get it not even you hehe.</p>

        <h2>Who is this girl?</h2>
        <p>She is this girl who doesn’t like tomatoes in her burger (addon: burnt tomatoes are good to go). This girl who stays up late night playing Roblox eating ice cream, this girl who can't live without music and loves her big 3 Chase Atlantic, NBHD and Arctic Monkeys. green is her favourite colour but apparently it shifts from blue and green. her favourite season is winter, she hates sweating so makes sense and also I think she enjoys wearing her winter clothes. Has a mole on her right arm. the fact that she ends up injuring herself all the time in the most weirdest ways or the fact that she never believed in santa in the first place (“UHM WHAT” yes exactly). she has this spirit of jest to her. After a certain point she has been an absolute bully to me. No that is not cute LET ME BE. BE NICE TO ME. Do not get fooled by her cute appearance, an actual menace to the society she is. She loves Disney and Studio Ghibli, pretty sure she has seen almost every movie of both the studios or maybe any animation studio for the matter of fact for someone who doesn't watch that many movies, that's a certain catch. Bookworm and also a major girlboss. She is very very competitive and she also loves beaches. Her love for noodles always surprised me. Actually no it kinda suits her character, her friends did call her chinky biscuit LMFAO. But there’s always a catch with her right, for someone who has tasted a variety of food, her favourite food is dosa. yes, you heard me right, dosa. if you stay long enough with her you’ll see how she talks to herself lmao. sometimes even out loud, like replaying something in her head by telling it out loud. its a funny sight. but what is all this, her actual catch is she has the prettiest smile and an even prettier laugh. idk if its me but it can definitely mend souls. lmao who am I kidding, I love her. </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">I LOVE YOU KIMAYA.</p>
        <p>I love you Kimaya Esha Venugopal. I deeply, extremely, awfully, intensely, tremendously, exceedingly am in love with you as a childhood friend, as a highschool sweetheart, as a soulmate, as a confidant, as a rival, as a peer, as a playmate, as a roblox buddy, as a smashkarts buddy,as the person I want to talk to about my day , as a gossip girl,as an advisor,as a mediator,as someone to try a new thing with, as a person to explore places with, as a mail friend, as a discord friend, as a cambridge friend, as a Telugu-Kannada-Marathi friend, but the most important of it all, as a best friend. It was always you or about you. Jim and Pam. Ma'am here I would like to tell you. In my head Jim was me and Pam was you. Pam is this person who always laughs and has this sense of funny rivalry or getting back at each other game with Jim and she draws and paints and went to art school for design. You are kidding me right,that is like a you from a parallel universe. Ah every reel I liked about it, I always saw you in it. The whole of office was always about you. I spent my time watching the office originally only thinking about you. I could tell every dialogue of Jim and Pam and put it to our case lmao.Maybe every song I listen to it is about you or every romcom I watch is about you or every feel good movie is about you or even a pinterest post or a twitter tweet.Maybe I forced myself to see kpop demon hunters because of how much you loved it, well ended up loving the movie.I don't know a single plot line of what happened in the exorcist the other day at Sharada’s home because I was sitting and staring at your face the entire while.I always have a set plan on how things should go and what I shoudl talk about in a day or place but the moment I meet you in person, my whole system just breaks down and I end up either shutting up like a weird dude or end up talking way too much ,again like a weird dude. Every meet I'll be looking out for where you are so after every funny moment I can see if you're laughing. But
 <p style="text-align: center;">I SHOULD BE THE ONE MAKING YOU LAUGH KIMAYA. 
<p style="text-align: center;">I should be the one holding your heels
    or your bag or your heavy jacket.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I should be the one untangling your headphones.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I should be the one driving you home.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I should be the one holding the door for you.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I should be the one pulling your chair out for you.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I should be the one holding your umbrella.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I should be the one carrying the heavy end of the couch.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I should be the one finding your favorite show for you.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I should be the one holding your hand when you cross the street.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I should be the one taking cute pictures of you.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I should be the one getting you coffee.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I should be walking your pet OUR PET. IT SHOULD BE ME</p>. </p></p>
        <p>I could tell it a million times to everyone out loud but maybe I don't find the need to tell it to anyone anymore. 
No one would really understand, I don't understand it myself sometimes. Was never really ready when it happened on October 31st of 2024 during Diwali. But I can say now I know you or at least am closer and for how much of an idiot I have been all this while I want to know you more until I'm finally in your actual inner circle ehe or maybe I dont even care if I'm in the circle as long as I get to see you smile when I'm with you.</p>

        <h2>Akai ito, "The Red Thread of Fate"</h2>
        <p>The Akai Ito is a popular Japanese folklore that suggests a red thread, invisible to the naked eye, is tied to the little finger of each person. This thread connects them to their soulmate. According to the legend, no matter how far apart two people are, or how many obstacles they face, the red thread will guide them to one another. The thread can stretch and tangle, symbolizing the challenges and complications that may arise in a relationship, but it always remains connected, representing the enduring nature of the destined bond. </p>
        <p>Why did I barely talk to you in eighth and get closer later on? </p>
        <p>Why did I join the chess match in the last minute? </p>
        <p>Why did Jeevan have to send that completely unrelated “I love Kimaya” sticker randomly made in your gc? </p>
        <p>Why did your mic get unmuted by mistake in the movie night that day? </p>
        <p>Why did Donald Duck have to have a bow on his neck?</p>
        <p>Well not the greatest believer of coincidences, I had learnt about this whole theory back in 9th grade and I've always loved the idea. Everyone is not just living their lives, they are the main character in their own life. Everyone is meant to be alive in this world and they get to find their own happiness in people, places and things. And take it up a notch. They were destined to meet these people, places, things and THE PERSON. I believe it had to be something or at least I choose to believe the red string theory for this matter of fact. To symbolise that, that's what I made the keychain for. Yes I crocheted the “bow” myself. It took me seven long years to get here Kimaya. And as optimistic as I am, this time if it's a yes, We are doing it right. I am doing it right and also out of context. I am getting myself a dog and we are getting you a cat. I really understand why you like cats now. You actually did tell that but I thought the dog would eat the cat. I really don't think so. This time no over complication and ohmygod direct communication. I don't wanna have these long calls with you or meet you often.Ma'am I think we are at the place where all of that does not matter anymore. Maybe just read your diary on a few lucky days ehe. Just wanna keep laughing with you as long as you are absolutely comfortable with me. Maybe I do not know you completely or maybe I am not even close to knowing you. But I do know you way better than how much I had known before. This is what this whole thing is for. But mainly its an apology letter.</p>
        <p>But yes, Ah, I have a million shots to give and a million more to take but I don't know how many times you would like to be shot at. </p>
        <p>I remember this picture someone drew of me, a head with curly hair. We were choosing a profile picture for your whatsapp and I asked you what makes you go awhfauohefhaeifiaemf. And you sent that picture. I remember smiling like an idiot at the phone. Do you still feel that way? Do I still make you go huesafhoaehcfaeiocf? Do I? this whole thing is a little scary to accept and thats why I've been procrastinating this entire thing for a good while. maybe maybe there’s a possibility you don’t feel the same way Kimaya. the Kimaya even before we were together on mail. While reading the mails, its almost like she felt comfort in me. Do you still feel the same way? Do you still feel like talking about how your day to me? You used to mail me saying how you missed me and wanted to spend time with me. Do you still feel that way? when you called things off on april 14 and how we tackled things after that, I realised it later on, maybe I forced you a little into it. but you are not the type to get forced into things either so I really don’t know. But honestly maybe this whole thing was just one sided and I made too much of it in my head. That said for someone who wrote this much I do not know, I have no clue like absolutely zero clue of how you are going to answer the question on the next page. You told me once about how you cried so much that your body literally hurt after it and I remember telling myself that day that she should never ever feel that way again ever and only make her feel fun and happy and to think that I even remotely made you feel uncomfortable, as much as it kills me to say this, You have no clue how scared I am. Even the thought of not having you next to me hurts. Like literally my body physically tingles. I'd rather have someone hammer my head a billion times than see you with someone else. But phew I’ve promised myself to tell this, Kimaya, you don't have to put up with this goofy ass anymore. Incase the answer for the question is a no, It is alright. You shall tell me. This time I know I'll understand. I “shant" trouble you anymore(shant lmao).  I mean it. </p>
        <p>Even genie would not be able to grant that certain wish lmao. To make somebody love someone .
<p>Can't force that can we.</p>
<p>Do not fool yourself.</p>
<p>Maybe you did only love the idea of me.</p>
<p>Phew</p>
<p>I won't be sad. Lmao, thats not true. But I won't be sad eventually.</p>
<p>Why am I fighting the fact.</p>
<p>You are you.</p>
<p>I am me.</p>
<p>I understand that you don't belong with me.</p>
<p>You belong with someone who you want to be with.</p></p>
        <p>Well yes that's that. Conventional dating is not my thing man, I don't know how it works and I don't exactly like how it works either. I didn't know how it was supposed to be the time we dated either, I tried what I could but well yeah lmao it ended up as a disaster. Maybe I'll never be able to. I always wanted to make you feel special or at least when you were with me. I don’t talk a lot Kimaya, believe it or not, but when I'm with my favourite people its another case completely. But when I'm with you, ohmygod yap-king (like seriously someone tape this guy’s mouth) I tried to be the best I can. I tried to make the right decisions, but damn here we are. Phew. I am definitely not this book written man that I aspire to be. I might just be that unusual whimsical boy. Life wise yes I have definitely not reached my potential and this is not even what I'm meant to be but there's time to get back to where I want to be in life. But me as in me, this is me. Tried to change it but this is me. And lmao yes definitely high maintenance. Because bro you are no maintenance at all ohmygod. You remember how one day I called you and asked you if you were sure about this? And you said you were a scared that you wouldn't be able to give me anything. You gave me everything Kimaya. Everything. It was me who forgot to realize. I am sorry ma’am. </p>
        <p>Well one more thing.
As a hopeless romantic looking around and seeing everyone together, do I regret this whole thing of tough love not being able to have the conventionally normal love life (?)
<p>Nope</p> 
<p>Never.</p> 
<p>Not a single day. </p></p>
        <p>That Vishnu who was waiting every evening to open that mail app and see the top notification highlighted in white with a new mail would never regret it, the fun he had while reading every mail and having an insight into your day; he can never regret it. To see you laugh for all the stupidity well lmao he definitely won't regret it. There has not been a day which I spent unhappily with you. When you were there everything was shiny and fun. Understanding this person who is such an enigma of a character accept it or not; I had so much fun. And to know the different sides of you. Moreover you're not the kind of person to share any of it to everyone just like that, yeah I felt special. I learnt so much myself. Looking back at everything I have grown basically with you, both time-wise and life-wise. We have done everything ma'am. In one form or another I have shared pretty much everything to you. All this feelings I have towards you is not exactly surprising, everyone loves you. But the fact that a person like that felt comfort in me and liked me is something I shall always cherish. I just want you to remember this day as the day I actually asked you out. When you look back to everything, as “apathetic” as you believe you are to be, I wish, I hope you feel something at all. Not exactly remorse but at least something to smile about. </p>
        <p>Anyway, The moment you mentioned about how you had a character soft toy collection but it had a Donald Duck soft toy left to join it, I decided on buying that for your birthday. That's my actual gift. Well if things go right and I did give you the other box on your birthday. The proposal box I would like to call it. That is me trying to crochet. DONT LAUGH. It was supposed to be a pretty red bow that you could wear on your hair lady. I genuinely tried poda. It ended up as this small idk what it is now. It's a viz bow ehe. Weirdly enough that took me 9 hours to make and that would be my first crochet ever phew. The audacity to send that to a design student. Yes I get it. There was a bow on the neck of Donald Duck ma’am, I never planned it thinking of that, the crocheted bow was a different idea but I later got to know that mr ducky had a bow on his neck too. I was genuinely surprised. Maybe all of this was meant to be. Maybe. Well I added another bow. So there are exactly 3 bows. One on the proposal box. One on Mr Donald Duck. One is the bow I made. Three for Good Omen ehe. Well yeah this took like 120 hours to write and a thousand more to plan. Hopefully I put in everything. Originally I thought I could finish all of this by your birthday but I could not get myself to finish it, I’ll just accept it. I was scared, very very scared of what might happen. The whole of last week I could not even text to you properly but the day I saw you on your birthday, weirdly it just made sense and felt alright. But at least I could give the box on Saturday itself.</p>
        <p>Incase this ends how I do not want it to end, its alright, what can be done, happens in life right. Phew. Just incase it ends up in that way, Maybe I won't get to tell you this, This is the only time I'm telling someone about this. First and last. This whole batman wannabe. Yes it is a running joke but not exactly for me , the other part of batman that has this past that always keeps killing him . But it's not just batman, its all these characters with that same dark touch to it. I never talked about it to anyone but maybe I've always wanted to tell this to you. This thing happened in the past, not the greatest of things to happen to people. It did cause of a lot of distress and always does and always will but ma'am, You helped out during that and after that and I shall always remember that. You will not be aware of it maybe never will. But I  wanted you to know. Very much. Phew. That’s all of it. </p>
        <p>However this goes, The one thing that I want you to always know and look back to, Why did I love you, 
Because you had The prettiest smile and the purest heart.</p>
